## 🌿 GitFlow Branch Strategy
To maintain a structured workflow, we follow **GitFlow** for version control:

### 📌 Branches:
- **`main`** – Stable, production-ready code.
- **`develop`** – Active development branch (merged into `main` upon release).
- **`feature/{feature-name}`** – Individual features branched from `develop`.
- **`release/{version}`** – Prepares a new release from `develop`, allowing final fixes before merging into `main`.
- **`hotfix/{fix-name}`** – Critical fixes applied directly to `main`, then merged into `develop`.

### 🚀 Workflow:
1. **Starting a Feature:**
   ```sh
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b feature/{feature-name}
   ```
2. **Finishing a Feature:**
   ```sh
   git checkout develop
   git merge feature/{feature-name}
   git branch -d feature/{feature-name}
   ```
3. **Creating a Release:**
   ```sh
   git checkout develop
   git checkout -b release/{version}
   ```
4. **Applying Hotfixes:**
   ```sh
   git checkout main
   git checkout -b hotfix/{fix-name}
   ```

Following this structure ensures a clean and efficient development cycle! 🔥
